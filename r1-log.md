# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Manikanta Inugurthi

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [Sept 5, Wednesday, 2018].

## Log

### R1D1 
Created a new repository in github for the [Music player app](https://github.com/me-manikanta/Music-Player)

### R1D2
Created an app called [MVP-Example](https://github.com/me-manikanta/MVP-Example) which is built on [MVP architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93presenter)

### R1D3
Created a new Repository called [Simple note](https://github.com/me-manikanta/Simple-Note) which is a note taking application built with [ROOM Database](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room) and on [MVVM Architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93viewmodel)

### R1D4
Created ViewModels for [Simple note](https://github.com/me-manikanta/Simple-Note) and completed the MainActivity of the app

### R1D5
Completed writing the code of [Simple note](https://github.com/me-manikanta/Simple-Note) and tested it

### R1D6
Fixed minor bugs in [Simple note](https://github.com/me-manikanta/Simple-Note) app

### R1D7
Started a new Project called [Snake AI](https://github.com/me-manikanta/Snake-Game-AI) and created a repository for the same
Completed writing the main functionality of the game

### R1D8
Completed writing [Matrix](https://github.com/me-manikanta/Snake-Game-AI/blob/master/Snake_AI/Matrix.pde) class and [NeuralNetwork](https://github.com/me-manikanta/Snake-Game-AI/blob/master/Snake_AI/NeuralNetwork.pde) class for the game AI

[Matrix](https://github.com/me-manikanta/Snake-Game-AI/blob/master/Snake_AI/Matrix.pde) class contains all the possible matrix operations that are possibly required 

[NeuralNetwork](https://github.com/me-manikanta/Snake-Game-AI/blob/master/Snake_AI/NeuralNetwork.pde) class contains the entire structure of the neural network of the snake game

I made these 2 classes such that anyone or even myself can use these 2 classes, if there is any neural network involved in the respective project

### R1D9
Created [Population](https://github.com/me-manikanta/Snake-Game-AI/blob/master/Snake_AI/Population.pde) class and [World](https://github.com/me-manikanta/Snake-Game-AI/blob/master/Snake_AI/World.pde) class, population represents a bunch of snakes whereas world represents a bunch of species or population. Added fitness function to the snake. The game AI is perfectly running with a highscore of 8 after 100 generations

### R1D10
Added some of the minor functionalities that are required by the AI

### R1D11
Didn't code much but learned some core concepts of android and ML

### R1D12
Started Calendar app, I started this so as to improve my skillset more by making this app so much user friendly.
Inspration for this app came from [SimpleCalendar](https://github.com/SimpleMobileTools/Simple-Calendar) app and probably most of the code will be a replica of the same.

### R1D13
This is after a long pause as I have gone for a trip. Started a new RL [course](theschool.ai) by Siraj Raval. Created a new [Repository](https://github.com/me-manikanta/Move-37-Course) for the same. Updated the code for introduction to RL.

### R1D14
Created a Sensor Network folder but completed writing the code of only GridWorld.py

### R1D15
Completed the Sensor Network code and learned about Markov's law and Bellman equation

### R1D16
Completed writing the Code of Sports betting using value iteration(This is the part of RL course)

### R1D17
Completer writing the code of iPhoneXSSupplyChain using policy iteration(This is the part of RL course)
Completed the Week 1 assignment of AndrewNG course
